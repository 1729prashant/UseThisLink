Thank you for your interest in contributing to this repo (https://github.com/1729prashant/UseThisLink). To keep our project free and open for everyone, we require that all contributions adhere to the following guidelines.

## 1. Licensing of Contributions
By contributing to this repository, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3). This means that:

Free Use and Modification: Anyone may use, modify, and distribute your contributions as long as they do so under the GPLv3 terms.

Reciprocity: All derivative works must also remain free and open under the GPLv3. No contributor or third party may take your work, modify it, and then restrict others from using or modifying it further.

## 2. Monetization and Use of Modified Versions
While the project’s open-source nature means that you (and anyone else) are free to use and even commercialize your own modifications:

Freedom for All: No one may enforce restrictions that prevent others from using, modifying, or distributing the original or any modified versions of the code.

Prevention of Exclusive Monetization: If you create a modified version of this project, you are free to earn revenue from your improvements. However, you may not enforce conditions that would stop others from accessing the original code or its derivatives under GPLv3 terms. In other words, you cannot make money by “locking out” other developers from using or contributing to improvements that build on the original work.

## 3. How This Works in Practice
Core Principle: The GPLv3 license already ensures that all versions of the code remain free and open for use. Our additional guidelines reinforce that no contributor or entity may claim exclusive rights over the improvements to the point of restricting community access.

Enforcement: Should a modified version be used in a way that appears to restrict the open use and modification rights granted by the GPLv3 (for example, by adding proprietary hooks that prevent others from building upon the code), the maintainers of this repository (https://github.com/1729prashant/UseThisLink) reserve the right to review and, if necessary, take action to ensure compliance with the open nature of the project.

## 4. Acknowledgment
By contributing to this project, you acknowledge and agree to:

License your contributions under GPLv3.

Not attempt to restrict others’ rights to use, modify, or distribute the code, regardless of any modifications made.

Understand that while you may monetize your own derivative works, such monetization must not come at the expense of the community’s freedom to use the original or further modified versions of the code.

## 5. Contact and Questions
If you have any questions about these terms or need clarification on any point, please open an issue or contact the maintainers directly.
